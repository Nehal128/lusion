                        We are taking orders as normal, and are no longer
                        limiting the maximum quantity of each product to 6 in
                        the UK as we have the majority of our core range in
                        stock. Our courier partners’ ability to deliver remains
                        largely unaffected, although there are surcharges to
                        some destinations that will be shown on checkout if they
                        apply. We are currently experiencing high demand, and
                        are running at 1-2 working days for your order to be
                        dispatched.. 70% of our core range is in stock and
                        available, and we are receiving more supplies daily. We
                        have paused our Chilled/Fresh service until further
                        notice. You can order from our Ambient range as usual.
                        If a product is ‘In Stock’ on the website, we have it
                        available in our warehouse. We will keep you updated of
                        any changes.

                  <h4>Shipping Times</h4>
                  <p>
                    Your order will ship via USPS, UPS or UPS Surepost,
                    depending on what shipping option you select at checkout.
                    Same day shipping for orders placed until 12 PM PST. Details
                    of the various shipping options are outlined below: We ship
                    only within the continental United States. We do not
                    currently ship to PO boxes, APO, or FPO addresses or
                    internationally. All flat rate shipping orders over $49 will
                    ship for free.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Flat Rate Shipping - on orders over $49</li>
                    <li>2nd Day Air - UPS</li>
                    <li>Next Day Air - UPS</li>

                  <p>
                    See below for approximate delivery times based on what zone
                    you’re shipping to. Products from the same order are often
                    shipped from different warehouses. This does not affect your
                    shipping cost, but may require the order to be delivered in
                    multiple packages and the shipping time may vary.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Tracking of orders</h4>

                    order confirmation email. A shipment notification email with
